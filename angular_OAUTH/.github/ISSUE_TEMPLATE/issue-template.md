Thanks for taking a moment to open an issue!
Here are some guidelines for issues:

- **Bugs need steps to reproduce!** Please add a minimal but complete set of steps to reproduce the issue. This is needed to reliably help.
- **Questions might get limited attention.** This sample is a side-project of _one_ person. I might not have time to help anyone, esp. with app-specific questions (ask a colleague, consultant, or Stack Overflow, please), or library-specific questions (open an issue on the library's issue list please).
- **Scope is intentionally small.** There is intentionally no documentation (the code _is_ the documentation), and only a small number of features. This is just a _sample_ repository. Build your own use cases from it.

Opening an issue is also a good step before contributing a PR, so we can have a short discussion about any fix or addition.

Thanks again for taking an interest in this sample!
